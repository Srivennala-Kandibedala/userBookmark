# userBookmark
The project is designed using popular MVC and Singleton patterns. A popular Software development process called Test Driven Development is also used on some parts of code where test cases are wriiten before the real logic.
The project allows 5 users and 15 bookmarks, these 15 bookmarks are 5 from each category Movie, Book and WebLink. Each user can bookmark atmost 5 items from any of the 3 categories allowing duplicates.
The bookmarking decision is performed randomly and we use the randomization function from the math class to perform this. 
A new feature called user kid friendly is introduced. Any bookmark could be marked as kid friendly by an editor or a chief editor. The three states are approve reject and unknown for this field.
The final feature is to share the kid friendly bookmarks with partner friendly websites. We have limited the use of this to only kid friendly bookmarks and not the regular bookmarks and in specific to books and weblinks. Only an editor and chief editor are permitted to use this feature.
